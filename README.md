# Spamdetection Web UI

This is the official web frontend for the SECANA Spamdetection Machine Learning Project.
Using Flask as a Framework and Bootstrap for designing the site, we managed to develop a simple to use interface for checking your mails.

This frontend is only compatible with the official [Spamdetection project](https://github.com/konstantingoretzki/spamdetection).
